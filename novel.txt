He didn't know why they were there... but they were.
But it was not unusual for me to be surprised by them.
Still, I was a bit shocket to see them there. 
And then we were all happy and started githubbing and all. Hey, double rainbowwww...
There are skittles at the end of the double rainbow.
and then they said…”skittles… taste of rainbow…”
then someone shouted, "oh shit I'm diabetic!", call an ambulance.
they all woke up and realized it was just a dream...today is another day...
